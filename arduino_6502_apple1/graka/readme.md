# apple 1 with old graphics card and ps/2 keyboard

In June 2018, someone from mk forum offered an old graphics card for just shipping costs (thx GÃ¼nter).

liesmich.txt contains some configuration explanations for this card and V3.bin is the char eprom 2716 content saved.

I interfaced my apple 1 arduino emulator and a ps/2 keyboard to it.
